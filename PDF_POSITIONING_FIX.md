# PDF Positioning Fix for DigitalBGA Offer Letters

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Variable Positioning
Updated the coordinates in `app/offer/[id]/page.tsx` for proper placement:

#### Recipient Name (After "Dear")
- **X Position**: 60 (horizontal placement after "Dear ")
- **Y Position**: height - 145 (line 3 of the document)

#### Start Date (After "8:00AM CST on")
- **X Position**: 260 (adjusted to properly align after the time text)
- **Y Position**: height - 253 (middle section of first page)

#### Signature Section (Bottom of page)
- **Signature X**: 90 (left side "Accepted By:" field)
- **Signature Y**: 95 (bottom of page)
- **Date X**: 340 (right side "Date" field)
- **Date Y**: 95 (same height as signature)

### 2. Added Automatic Date/Timestamp
The system now automatically adds the current date next to the signature when the offer is signed.

### 3. Created Coordinate Testing Tool
Added `/admin/test-digitalbga-coordinates` page to help fine-tune positions:
- Interactive coordinate adjustment
- Real-time preview of values
- Reference guide for PDF positioning
- Instructions for testing

## How to Test

1. Send a test offer to a candidate
2. Open the offer signing page
3. Sign the offer and verify:
   - Candidate name appears after "Dear"
   - Start date appears after "8:00AM CST on"
   - Signature appears in the "Accepted By:" field
   - Current date appears in the "Date" field

## Fine-Tuning

If positions need adjustment:
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ "DigitalBGA Coordinate Tester"
2. Adjust the coordinate values
3. Update the values in `app/offer/[id]/page.tsx`
4. Test with a new offer

## PDF Coordinate System

- Origin (0,0) is at bottom-left
- X increases moving right
- Y increases moving up
- Standard letter: 612 x 792 points
